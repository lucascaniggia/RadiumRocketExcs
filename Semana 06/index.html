      President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill cleared its final
      congressional hurdle Wednesday, with the House passing the bill on a
      220-to-211 vote, sending it to the president for his signature.

      The vote caps a nearly two-month sprint from the time Biden first unveiled
      his American Rescue Plan, through tough negotiations in the Senate to its
      final approval largely in the form it was first proposed. Biden plans to
      sign the legislation on Friday.

      The bill is a major political victory for the new president, displaying
      his influence over a Democratic Party in control of Congress by the
      thinnest of margins. At the same time, the partisan divide over the bill
      foreshadows the difficulty Biden will have in enacting the multi-trillion
      dollar, longer-term economic program he wants later this year.

      Most Americans will be receiving direct payments of $1,400, with checks
      starting to go out within days. The bill provides new health-insurance
      subsidies and child-tax credits, while extending $300 per week
      supplemental unemployment benefits into September. There’s also $360
      billion for state and local governments, a bailout for troubled union
      pensions and funds to ramp up vaccinations and school re-openings.

      The legislation passed without a single Republican vote in either the
      House or Senate, in sharp contrast to the bipartisan five previous
      bipartisan Covid-19 bills enacted under President Donald Trump, before the
      pandemic began retreating amid the current vaccination drive.

      A group of 11 Republican senators had proposed a $650 billion stimulus
      plan with more narrowly targeted benefits and a focus on anti-virus

      the gulf between their idea and Democrats’ plans was too large to try to
      bridge.

      The bill is far bigger than initial Wall Street expectations of what could
      be accomplished in a closely divided Congress. Economists this week were
      upping their projections for growth to incorporate the impact. Morgan
      Stanley on Tuesday raised their 2021 forecast for U.S. economic growth to
      7.3%, a pace unsurpassed since the Korean War boom in 1951.

      Help is targeted toward the lowest-earning Americans. A study from the Tax
      Policy Center found that incomes of the lowest fifth of earners will jump
      20%, the highest among income groups. That will help speed money into the
      economy, as those in the lowest brackets spend more of their budgets on
      basic household needs, including health care, food and clothing.

      The bill provides a template for a potential longer-term expansion of an

      while tax forgiveness on jobless benefits and student-debt relief will
      give help to millions more.
