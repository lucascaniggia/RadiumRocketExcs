        President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill cleared its
        final congressional hurdle Wednesday, with the House passing the bill on
        a 220-to-211 vote, sending it to the president for his signature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vote caps a nearly two-month sprint from the time Biden first
        unveiled his American Rescue Plan, through tough negotiations in the
        Senate to its final approval largely in the form it was first proposed.
        Biden plans to sign the legislation on Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bill is a major political victory for the new president, displaying
        his influence over a Democratic Party in control of Congress by the
        thinnest of margins. At the same time, the partisan divide over the bill
        foreshadows the difficulty Biden will have in enacting the
        multi-trillion dollar, longer-term economic program he wants later this
        year.

        Most Americans will be receiving direct payments of $1,400, with checks
        starting to go out within days. The bill provides new health-insurance
        subsidies and child-tax credits, while extending $300 per week
        supplemental unemployment benefits into September. There’s also $360
        billion for state and local governments, a bailout for troubled union
        pensions and funds to ramp up vaccinations and school re-openings.

      <h3>Contributions to GDP From $1.9 Trillion Plan</h3>

      <p>
        “I join President Biden in his promise: help is on the way,” House
        Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as debate concluded, noting that the vote came
        on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the coronavirus being declared
        a pandemic and reciting the toll it’s wreaked on America. “This
        legislation puts nearly $1 trillion in the pockets of the American
        people.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Biden administration will focus on moving “swiftly” to implement the
        bill while also engaging officials -- beginning with the president and
        vice president -- to build public awareness and support for its
        provisions, White House deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon said
        in a Wednesday memo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The administration and Democratic lawmakers all plan to draw attention
        to 10 ways they say the bill will help Americans, from providing direct
        checks to giving support for small businesses to reopening schools. The
        White House plans days to address each theme.

      <p>
        The legislation passed without a single Republican vote in either the
        House or Senate, in sharp contrast to the bipartisan five previous
        bipartisan Covid-19 bills enacted under President Donald Trump, before
        the pandemic began retreating amid the current vaccination drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Representative Jared Golden of Maine was the lone Democratic no vote. He
        also had voted against the version that passed the House earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Republicans blasted Biden, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck
        Schumer for rejecting more modest proposals. With the economy already on
        the rebound, they said the aid bill was excessive and will escalate
        financial risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You can’t just keep adding mountains of debt at hundreds of billions at
        a time” without consequence, said Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2
        House Republican. “When you look at the priorities of Speaker Pelosi,
        it’s to spend as much money as quickly as possible on her socialist
        agenda.”
      </p>
      <img src="/Users/mac/Desktop/Radium Rocket/Semana 06/img1.png" />
      <br />
      <p>
        Republicans especially objected to the more than $360 billion in state
        and local government funds being provided when many states are not
        showing any revenue loss during the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Senator Rick Scott of Florida issued a call to governors and majors to
        return to Washington any funding that’s in excess of “federally
        reimbursable Covid-19 related expenses.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of 11 Republican senators had proposed a $650 billion stimulus
        plan with more narrowly targeted benefits and a focus on anti-virus
        efforts. Biden hosted most of them at the Oval Office, only to conclude
        the gulf between their idea and Democrats’ plans was too large to try to
        bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bill is far bigger than initial Wall Street expectations of what
        could be accomplished in a closely divided Congress. Economists this
        week were upping their projections for growth to incorporate the impact.
        Morgan Stanley on Tuesday raised their 2021 forecast for U.S. economic
        growth to 7.3%, a pace unsurpassed since the Korean War boom in 1951.
      </p>
      <h3>Sustained Support</h3>
      <p>
        The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that $1.1 trillion
        of spending under the relief bill would go out this year, with a further
        $476 billion coming in 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an MSNBC interview this week
        that the labor market would return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of
        2022, in line with many major analyst forecasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Help is targeted toward the lowest-earning Americans. A study from the
        Tax Policy Center found that incomes of the lowest fifth of earners will
        jump 20%, the highest among income groups. That will help speed money
        into the economy, as those in the lowest brackets spend more of their
        budgets on basic household needs, including health care, food and
        clothing.

        QuickTake: How Can I Qualify for That $1,400 Stimulus Check?
      </a>
      <p>
        About one-third of Americans plan to save their check, according to a
        survey by Morning Consult commissioned by Bloomberg News, much higher
        than the prior stimulus money. Around the same share said they’d
        purchase food, and one-quarter cited housing payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This will probably hit accounts before the end of the month,” said
        Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC. She upgraded
        forecasts mid-February that puts the U.S. on track to reach full
        employment by summer next year. “Not only does this get paid out quickly
        -- it actually gets spent very quickly.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The bill provides a template for a potential longer-term expansion of an
        American social-safety net that has long been much smaller than its
        European counterparts. Democrats say the near-$110 billion temporary
        expansion of the child-tax credit will help cut child poverty in half,
        while tax forgiveness on jobless benefits and student-debt relief will
        give help to millions more.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This legislation represents the boldest action taken on behalf of the
        American people since the Great Depression,” Democratic House Caucus
        Vice-Chairman Pete Aguilar of California said.

        The heated politics around the stimulus bill could jeopardize Biden’s
        hopes for a bipartisan infrastructure program, along with challenging
        plans for an immigration bill, voting reform, war powers reform or
        gun-safety measures. Such legislation is likely to be largely ineligible
        for the fast-track Senate procedure used to bypass a Republican
        filibuster, known as budget reconciliation.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s a bad start, and it’s going to make it much more difficult to get
        things done,” said veteran Republican lawmaker Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who
        claimed that GOP members could have ended up backing up to $900 billion
        in relief. “I would hope we can find common ground, but I just look at
        the legislation they keep bringing up.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Democrats counter that Republicans are dusting off their playbook from
        more than a decade ago, when blasting the Obama administration over
        deficit spending, along with a lackluster recovery, helped win control
        of the House in 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Partisanship is at a high level within the congressional chamber
        because Republicans have chosen obstruction over cooperation,” said
        Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 House Democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The popularity of the stimulus bill, and especially the direct payments
        that were first championed by Trump, are being employed by Democrats in
        their bid to defy historical trends during midterm elections by holding
        onto the House in the 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        While 2021 will prove memorable as a phase of “proactive fiscal
        expansion,” it’s far from clear this will last, Morgan Stanley analysts
        led by Michael Zezas wrote in a report dated March 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We would not conclude this is the beginning of a long-term trend, as a
        change in power in the midterm elections and/or a resurgence of popular
        concern regarding deficits could derail the trend beyond this year,” the
        Morgan Stanley team wrote.
